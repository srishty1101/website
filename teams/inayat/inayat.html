    <br><h2>ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN- CARE, WEAR, REPAIR</h2>
<h3><p>Our campaign “Care Wear Repair” aims at the minimal waste of clothes and promotes sustainable fashion. We are aiming to change the whole idea of our wardrobes. So, we have categorized the wardrobe into 4 parts: 
  Clothes which we use
   Clothes which we can donate -REUSE 
  Clothes which we are bored of or are not used by use any more due to any reason but are too new/costly to be donated - THRIFT
  Clothes which are not in a good condition to be donated but can be useful in making items like scrunchies - RECYCLE
