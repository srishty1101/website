    <br><h2>ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN- SAB PADHENGE AAGE BADHENGE</h2>
<h3><p>Our "Sab Padhenge Aage Badhenge" campaign aims at spreading awareness about the need of education for all. Education is our birth right and we believe that everyone shouldve access to it.. In this issue, the different initiatives taken by the team to address the problem and their impact have been described.</p>
<p>
  Some of the Successful Events:
  <br><br><u><b>1. Street Art: Chalk Graffiti</b></u><br>
  ADIRA organized an event: "Chalk Graffiti" at Taarangana '22, the Annual Cultural fest of IGDTUW, to raise awareness for the sustainable goals they advocate: Gender Equality, Quality Education and Reduced Inequalities.
   During the event, all interested onlookers were encouraged to express their thoughts using chalk, with the roads as a blank canvas, filled with ideas and thoughts of the students.
  The team members set the ball rolling by illustrating their ideas on the roads. This inspired students from IGDTUW and other universities, as well as faculty and known "influencers" and YouTubers to join and become a part of this awareness campaign. 
  Throughout the event, the members, including the President and the General Secretary, made the passersby aware of the campaign: "Sab Padhenge Aage Badhenge" and their work with SDGs 4, 5 and 10.
  
  <br><br><u><b>2. Digiteracy</b></u><BR>
  
  "DIGITERACY", was an insightful session hosted by ADIRA, in collaboration with FINIVESTA .
   Team FINIVESTA talked about the various government schemes which are meant for economically lower background people and help in opening a bank account .
  After a brief introduction, they gave comprehensive presentation on the use of digital payment by various UPI apps and also spoke about security in digital payement (advantages and diadvantages).
  The session was concluded by a successful and interactive Kahoot quiz.

  <br><h2>ENDLINE SURVEY</h2>
