  Some of the Successful Events:

  <br><br><u><b>1. Water footprint survey </b></u><br> A survey was conducted by the team members in offline mode where they interviewed the students of Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW) and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar University Delhi (AUD), to discuss our aim, vision and contributions followed by a series of questions to understand the current knowledge of college students.
  We talked to about 30 people during the conduct of this activity. The interviewees took keen interest in learning about the ever-increasing water footprint and its repercussions.
  The participating students were informed about the vision of Eudaimonia and our campaign for this cohort. The team talked about water footprint, and its consequences.
