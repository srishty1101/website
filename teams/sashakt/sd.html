    <br><h2>ABOUT THE TEAM</h2>
   <h3> <p> Team Sashakt Drishti works towards promoting SDG 11: 'Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable'. Our name represents the spirit of our team. Sashakt means strong and empowering while Drishti means sight. Hence our team is the symbolism of an empowering and strong sight towards SDG-11.
    Our team believes that making the cities safe, inclusive and sustainable is of the utmost importance since the cities are the root of every other world problem. To combat issues like poverty, climate change, gender discrimination, health etc. one must first make our cities sustainable. Doing so will pave the path to success and fulfillment of the other sustainable development goals.

    <br><h2>ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN- CHALE STREE, STRESS FREE</h2>
<h3><p>Most of us travel in the metro quite often. In fact, for most of the working women, the metro is the most common means to travel. But, there are a lot of problems that women face while traveling, the biggest concern being safety and hygiene. Some of the common problems are as follows:
  <BR>- Lack of proper washrooms: Traveling for women through the metro becomes inconvenient because of the unavailability of proper washrooms.
    <BR>- Lack of proper seating: Over 50% of women are anemic in India. More than 80% of women experience menstrual cramps.
      <BR>- Inaccessible escalators: Escalators might be available at most metro stations, but they are highly inaccessible. Placement of unattended escalators in isolated corners of metro stations becomes a major security concern for women.
        <BR>- Lack of sanitary products: Most menstruating women find themselves without sanitary products.
  </p>
  <p> Some of the Successful Events:
  <br><br><u><b>1. Comedy Night and Twitter Campaign-</b></u><br>We decided to target our audience through humor and we conducted a comedy night and Twitter Campaign on 27th April for the same. This was followed by a speech where we conveyed the problems faced by women who use the metro. Then we urged the audience to share their own experiences and anecdotes where they either faced issues or saw something going through an ordeal.
  The idea was to conduct an event that is engaging, and which motivates the participants to research on SDG-11 and at the same time also develop critical thinking towards the various problems that women face while traveling in the metro.
  This will help develop a critical mindset in the youth of today and they will be able to realize the problems that women face while traveling and also take measures on their personal end to help solve these problems.
  We tweeted about our campaign from our official Twitter handle and the students were asked to share their experiences of traveling in the metro by replying to that thread.
  
  <br><br><u><b>2. Photography Drive-</b></u><br>To support our Twitter campaign, we urged our audience to capture the moments where women are facing issues while using Delhi Metro in real time.
  The clarity that is provided by the visual aid like photographs and videos makes us realize the gravity of the situation as we can ourselves see the struggle faced by the women.
  We received an overwhelming response by the participants who clicked pictures and made videos at different metro stations where they observed gender discrepancies.
  The participants were asked to upload the relevant pictures and videos on google drive where we collected all of the visual proofs.
  Our plan is to prepare a report compiling the twitter response and these pictures and send them to the concerned authorities urging them to take the required action as soon as possible
